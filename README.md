# Finger Counter ✋🎙️

This is my mini project where I used **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **pyttsx3** to detect fingers from a webcam in real-time and speak out the count.  

When I show my hand to the camera:
- It counts how many fingers are up  
- Displays the number on the screen  
- Speaks the count using text-to-speech  



## 🚀 Features
- Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
- Counts raised fingers (0 to 5)
- Voice output using pyttsx3
- Works with webcam



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe  
- pyttsx3
